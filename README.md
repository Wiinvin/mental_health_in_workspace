This was a 20 hour binge coding attempt to analyze data and extract feature importance from ML model development. During this project, I tried to use minimal amount of functional programming from famous python packages such as pandas. Some functions can very well be run in less than 2 lines via SQLlike functional programming paradigms. More information about the project is in the _AAREADME.txt file. 

The push button scripts are in v0/ and v1 (run_*.sh) directories. Each file has plethora of comments. Details about the project are next to code themselves.

Final step: The visualization in output/ needs a few hours of work.
